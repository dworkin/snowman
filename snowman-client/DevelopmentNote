TODO:
Add and implement HPConverter.
Add and implement DistributedController.
Finish implementing BattleState.

Only generating Task process is multi-threaded. Everything else is controlled by the game loop in a mono-threaded fashion.

Mouse click movement:
  Frame 1:
	1. IController picks up the mouse click event.
	2. IController validates this event corresponds to a movement task.
	3. IController calculates and stores destination in side the entity.
  Frame 2:
	1. IController gets updated by Game loop and finds that there is a destination available,
	   so IController generates a MoveTask and pass in the entity.
	2. IController then sends out a move packet to the server.
  Frame 3:
    1. IController checks the entity has not reached the destination, therefore it does not
       remove the destination and generates another MoveTask and pass in the entity.
